                My name is <strong>Vince Nicholai J. Cortez</strong>, and I was born in Quezon City, where I spent most of my childhood. <sup>1</sup> 
                Occasionally, I would visit Cainta, where my mother resides. <sup>2</sup> 
                Whenever I was there, I played outside with my little brother and uncle, as there were not many other kids around. <sup>3</sup> 
                In Quezon City, however, I had plenty of friends. <sup>4</sup> 
                We loved playing tag, hide and seek, and riding our bikes around the neighborhood. <sup>5</sup> 
                I always enjoyed these outdoor games, but I was even more drawn to video games. <sup>6</sup> 
                <strong><em>Gaming was incredibly fun and immersive for me.</em></strong> <sup>7</sup> 
                My favorite was playing on my <strong><abbr title="Playstation Portable">PSP</abbr></strong>, which had so many great games. <sup>8</sup> 
                However, I could only use it when my father allowed me, so I always looked forward to those moments. <sup>9</sup> 
                Aside from video games, I was also a huge fan of <b>Transformers</b>. <sup>10</sup> 
                I had tons of Transformer toys and spent hours trying to assemble them. <sup>11</sup> 
                Sometimes, I would get frustrated when I could not figure them out and would end up throwing them in annoyance. <sup>12</sup> 
                <strong><em>Cartoons were another big part of my childhood.</em></strong> <sup>13</sup> 
                I loved spending entire days sitting on the couch, watching my favorite shows. <sup>14</sup> 
                Out of all of them, Ben 10 stood out the most. <sup>15</sup> 
                I was fascinated by how Ben could transform into different aliens, each with unique powers to defeat bad guys. <sup>16</sup> 
                It amazed me how every transformation brought something new and exciting. <sup>17</sup> 
                One thing I disliked about my childhood was how fat I was. <sup>18</sup> 
                I loved <strong>eating,</strong> and I would eat almost anything, except for fruits and vegetables. <sup>19</sup> 
                No matter how many times my parents lectured me about eating healthy, I just could not bring myself to like them. <sup>20</sup> 
                <strong>Vegetables, in particular, made me want to puke.</strong></strong> <sup>21</sup> 
                When it came to school, I was not very interested in studying. <sup>22</sup> 
                I found most subjects <strong>boring</strong> and <strong>difficult to understand.</strong> <sup>23</sup> 
                However, I enjoyed <b>Mathematics.</b> <sup>24</sup> 
                For some reason, solving numbers and equations felt <strong>exciting</strong> and <strong>satisfying.</strong> <sup>25</sup> 
                I was even awarded <em>Best in Math</em> at one point, which surprised even me. <sup>26</sup> 
                Aside from my love for games and cartoons, I was also a very curious child. <sup>27</sup> 
                I was always fascinated by the things I saw and wanted to learn more about how things worked. <sup>28</sup> 
                I also loved socializing and making new friends. Meeting new people and discovering new things made my childhood even more enjoyable. <sup>29</sup> 
                My childhood was full of fun, learning, and growing. <sup>30</sup> 
                Those memories still bring a smile to my face today. <sup>31</sup>

                As I moved into my teenage years, <strong><em>everything I perceived about the world suddenly changed in ways I had not expected.</em></strong> <sup>1</sup> 
                My <b>needs, wants, and priorities</b> were completely different from when I was still a child, and I began to notice the change in my perspective. <sup>2</sup> 
                I found myself going through adolescence, a time when I felt both confused and curious about many things. <sup>3</sup> 
                I started paying attention to how I dressed and looked because I realized I was not a child anymore, and people seemed to notice these things more. <sup>4</sup> 
                Despite all these changes in how I viewed myself, almost everything about my core personality stayed the same. <sup>5</sup> 
                I still loved to slack off, and procrastination became my go-to strategy when it came to homework and projects. <sup>6</sup> 
                Along with this, I met new friends during my teenage years, friends who would stick by me through both the good and the bad. <sup>7</sup> 
                Even though I had no idea how to commute from one place to another, that did not stop me from wanting to hang out with my friends. <sup>8</sup> 
                We’d spend hours at the mall or just hang out at each other's houses, creating memories that would last forever. <sup>9</sup> 
                <strong>My love for video games</strong> was something that did not change at all during this time. <sup>10</sup> 
                In fact, I had a PlayStation 4, which became my favorite pastime. <sup>11</sup> 
                <em>I played to my heart’s content, enjoying countless hours of gaming.</em> <sup>12</sup> 
                Not only that, but I also got a personal computer, which allowed me to play games with my friends online, <strong>connecting us in ways I had never experienced before.</strong> <sup>13</sup> 
                As I settled more into my teenage years, I began to develop new hobbies and interests. <sup>14</sup> 
                Watching <b>Anime</b> and <b>Korean dramas</b> also became my hobby. <sup>15</sup> 
                These shows were not just entertainment, they gave me new perspectives and opened my eyes to different cultures and stories. <sup>16</sup> 
                <strong><em>It was around this time that my love for technology grew stronger,</em></strong> and I knew I wanted to do something with it in the future. <sup>17</sup> 
                I became fascinated with how things worked, and I found myself often tampering with gadgets, curious to see how they operated and what would happen if I made small changes. <sup>18</sup> 
                <strong><em>This curiosity led me to make the decision to pursue a career in IT,</em></strong> as I realized that technology was something I wanted to be a part of for the rest of my life. <sup>19</sup> 
                Looking back, my teenage years were a time of growth, exploration, and discovering my true passions, setting the foundation for the person I am today. <sup>20</sup>

              <p>
                <strong><em>I was incredibly nervous about starting college,</em></strong> as it felt like a whole new world opening up for me. <sup>1</sup> 
                The idea of being in a new environment with new people was both <b>exciting</b> and <b>overwhelming.</b> <sup>2</sup> 
                I was eager to meet people who shared similar interests, and I knew from the very start that I had to approach college with a <em>sense of seriousness.</em> <sup>3</sup> 
                It was not just about the academics, <strong><em>it was about adjusting to a completely new phase in life.</em></strong> <sup>4</sup> 
                Attending <strong><abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr></strong>, a well-known university, added to the pressure, but it also gave me a <em>sense of pride.</em> <sup>5</sup> 
                The environment around <strong><abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr></strong> was very refreshing, and even the students were friendly, which made it all feel welcoming. <sup>6</sup> 
                The courses I enrolled in were interesting, and they sparked my curiosity, making me realize how much I truly enjoyed learning. <sup>7</sup> 
                However, as the semester progressed, the assignments and projects became a <em>huge challenge.</em> <sup>8</sup> 
                They were no joke, and the workload started to pile up faster than I could keep up with. <sup>9</sup> 
                It was really stressful, and I found myself losing sleep just to finish everything on time. <sup>10</sup> 
                I needed to make sure that I would listen carefully to the discussions since the exams and quizzes played a major role in my grades. <sup>11</sup> 
                <strong>Advanced reading became a must in order to maintain good grades.</strong> <sup>12</sup> 
                Despite the struggle, <strong><em>I managed to surprise myself by landing a scholarship,</em></strong> which was completely unexpected. <sup>13</sup> 
                It felt unreal because I never thought I had what it took to earn one. <sup>14</sup> 
                It also became pressuring since I wanted to maintain my scholarship, and I had to stay focused. <sup>15</sup> 
                The commute was exhausting, and I had to wake up early every morning to ensure I would not miss my first class. <sup>16</sup> 
                We always found time to hang out with friends and have a good time, making the most of the few moments we had together. <sup>17</sup> 
                Looking back, <strong><em>I realized that finding balance was key to surviving college.</em></strong> <sup>18</sup> 
                It was not just about doing well academically, but also about managing the stress and enjoying the experience as much as possible. <sup>19</sup> 
                In the end, college taught me the importance of perseverance, balance, and enjoying the journey, no matter how tough it gets. <sup>20</sup>
